Minecraft: Battle of the Blocks is currently in alpha stage.
============================================================

The idea is to:

 * split the players into teams (currently North and South)
 * splitting the world into areas reserved for each team (currently a line from spawn on the x axis)
 * alternate between 2 modes, building and battle
 * having a objective (currently CTF)

So you spawn at your tiny base, and starts to build and gather supplies (better hurry before they attack). After a while (currently 2000 server ticks) the mode changes to battle, now you must defend your flag and/or capture the other team’s flag. However no one can build anymore, and you must take the flag back to your own, so you can’t win by building a huge rock block.

Todo’s
-------

 * More/better commands for controlling the duration of the modes.
 * Start/Stop/Restart of “rounds”.
 * Running McBob in a parallel world.
